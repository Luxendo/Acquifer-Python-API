- SoftwareAutofocus in live mode 
-> switch setting mode should fix it

- following sequence works
-> need to define channel in script mode before (use a instance variable holding current state)
```
setScriptMode(1)
setBrightField()
acquire()
```
this one freeze the GUI (have to kill it)
```
setScriptMode(0) # configuring channel in live mode
setBrightField()
setScriptMode(1) # switching to script mode before camera acquisition
acquire()
```

- SofwareAutofocus in script mode is not returning anything
is it used by the next acquire command automatically ?


- offsetAF for SetBrightField
Does this value affect the autofocus/acquire ? 
Since for both autofocus/acquire one defines the zStackCenter, the offset could be encoded manually

ex : 
zCenter = SoftwareAutofocus()
acquire(zCenter-offset, ...) 

- after hard-reboot (IP steckdose off/on), empty wellId, well number X,Y, and temperature with acquire via tcpip, ex:

Default metadata tags, defined in the ImageFilenameAttribute ?

X,Y and temperature still blank

After moving XY via the GUI, the value is correctly populated
Same after switching on temperature regulation the TM tag is populated
