- SoftwareAutofocus in live mode 
The AF is executed, the plot is shown and the centre value is returned.
But the gui seems to freeze, the axis are responsive but not the camera.
Quitting the GUI (no need to kill it), and restarting works then.

> print im.runSoftwareAutofocus(50, 10, 5)
SoftwareAutofocus(50.0, 10, 5.0)
32.5
> print im.getMode()
live

- following sequence works
```
setScriptMode(1)
setBrightField()
acquire()
```
this one freeze the GUI (have to kill it)
```
setScriptMode(0) # configuring channel in live mode
setBrightField()
setScriptMode(1) # switching to script mode before camera acquisition
acquire()
```

- SofwareAutofocus in script mode is not returning anything
is it used by the next acquire command automatically ?

- SetImageFileNameAttribute
For the Coordinate attribute, the user would have to specify the leading slash,
Should we force it ? or optional as part of python

- offsetAF for SetBrightField
Does this value affect the autofocus/acquire ? 
Since for both autofocus/acquire one defines the zStackCenter, the offset could be encoded manually

ex : 
zCenter = SoftwareAutofocus()
acquire(zCenter-offset, ...) 

- after hard-reboot (IP steckdose off/on), empty wellId, well number X,Y, and temperature with acquire via tcpip, ex:
PO01--LO001--CO1--SL001--PX32500--PW0080--IN0120--TM000--X000000--Y000000--Z002200--T1925973109--WE00000.tif

After setting a custom well id, well number, subposition and timepoint iteration
X,Y and temperature still blank
-B012--PO10--LO002--CO1--SL002--PX32500--PW0080--IN0120--TM000--X000000--Y000000--Z002100--T1926287248--WE00010.tif

After moving XY via the GUI, the value is correctly populated
Same after switching on temperature regulation the TM tag is populated
